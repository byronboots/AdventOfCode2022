# AdventOfCode2022
Project for tracking work in the AdventOfCode for 2022

2022 is my first year participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and this project will be used to track my work.

I've just completed an Intro to Computer Science course at university and while I do have some previous experience with Python, it is very minimal. These problems are being initially approached by trying to solve them using intro level skills as much as possible to cement those skills for my own benefit and avoid getting into copy/pasting code snippets that I don't fully understand and tweaking them to finally get an acceptable answer. Feel free to prvide feedback and participate in Advent of Code yourself!
